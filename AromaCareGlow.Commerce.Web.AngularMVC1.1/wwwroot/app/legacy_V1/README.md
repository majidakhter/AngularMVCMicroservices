# apihc-starter

A starter package to allow teams to run faster and get to business logic rather than setting up the project and all of its dependencies. This project will focus on getting a standard angular project template.

Getting started
1. Go to project folder and install dependencies:
npm install

2. Launch development server, and open localhost:4200 in your browser:
npm start
